# James Atkinson's NKU Project Repo

I will be making a basic customer relations management system that uses active records to store and call data inputted about customers. This change over has come about with the intended use of the Square® as a means to make on the spot invoices when needed. 

These records will include but are not limited to Account number, Name, Billling Address, Shipping address Suite number, (maybe) prefered Payment method, Email address, company contact (if a company).
This page is for internal use only and will not be viewable by customers.

This will ultimate behanded over to an aquantiance of of mine for use on his site [Centuries Past Trading Company](http://www.centuriespasttc.com "Centuries Past TC.") 

Thats also where the logo came from, used with their blessing of course.
