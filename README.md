# James Atkinson's NKU Project Repo

I will be making an invoice generation system that uses active records to store and call data inputted about customers

These records will include but are not limited to Account number, Name, Billling Address, Shipping address Suite number, Payment method, Email address, Quantities, Order number, tax ammount, total, company contact.
This page is for internal use only and will not be viewable by customers.

TODO:
